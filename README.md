KAPLAN INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE LONDON â€“ IYO COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMME  
Module Title: INTRO T PROGRAMMING
Pnumber:  P440014 
Name: REDA GHARDI  
Description of the Program:
This programme includes a data file called ImdbCSV.csv and two Python scripts called app.py and scrapimdb.py. IMDb information such as movie titles, release dates, genres, reviews, votes, gross earnings, Oscar nominations, and wins can be scraped using the scrapimdb.py script. After that, it cleans and organises the data before saving it in a CSV file called ImdbCSV.csv.

This CSV file is used by the app.py script, which uses Tkinter, a Python desktop application toolkit, to generate a graphical user interface (GUI). With information on movie titles, ratings, runtime, genres, and Oscar-related features, the application displays a list of the best films based on data from IMDb. Users are able to access extensive movie data in an aesthetically pleasing style thanks to this intuitive interface.
